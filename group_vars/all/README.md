** Variables README file.


The Content Pipeline project variables are designed to be set alongside your implementation of
Identity Management, Satellite and Ansible Automation Platform. The defaults provided in this
project are aligned with the example.ca domain used in the rhis_builder project for deploying
a sample Red Hat Infrastructure Standard environment. 

Please examine the domain_level.yml file first.
The variables here set scope for the entire pipeline project.
